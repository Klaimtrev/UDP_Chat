# UDP_Chat
## User Datagram Protocol (UDP) chat with server and clients.

UDP-based chat system with a client-server architecture. The system allows multiple clients to communicate through a central server, sending messages directly to specific users or broadcasting updates about logged-in users.

I made this project in Spring of 2020 for my CS 381 Introduction to Computer Networks

Here is a demonstration of this project

## Finite State Machines 

I also made finite state machine (FSM) diagrams to represent the client-server communication system using sockets.
